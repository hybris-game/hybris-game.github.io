<p>Hybris (from Ancient Greek húbris) refers to excessive pride or dangerous overconfidence. It was due to these traits
    that Atlantis, an island whose naval power besieged Athens in times long past, fell out of the Greek Gods' favour,
    which lead to its downfall and submergence in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Hybris is a 3D city builder where the player must employ finesse and strategy to expand their budding nation, all the
    while taking care not to draw the wrath of the gods upon themselves and ultimately succumbing to the same fate as
    the Atlanteans before them.</p>
